/**
 * The English catalogue (P09-11): every word MyShelf shows or says, grouped
 * by feature. British English, curly quotes and apostrophes (AGENTS.md §3).
 *
 * - A key is the path to a message: `t('loans.screen.title')`.
 * - `{name}` is a placeholder, filled from the call's parameters.
 * - An object of plural categories (`one`, `other`, …) is a plural,
 *   chosen by the `count` parameter; so a group must not have a key named
 *   `other`.
 * - A comment above a key tells a translator where it shows.
 *
 * How to add a language: docs/localisation.md.
